            brings a wealth of expertise to the events sector from her work at
            numerous festivals and on stages, including the Jungle Book
            adaptation by Metta Theatre. From 2007 to 2023, she directed and
            performed often and established a milestone as the first aerialist
            to perform at Breakin' Convention Sadler's Wells mainstage and the
            first trapeze artist to create work at Move It at London Excel
            mainstage. Working with English National Opera, Boy Blue, Ockham's
            Razor, and as a choreographer and dance instructor for Disney's The
            Lion King Cub Academy six-week audition program allowed her to use
            her variety of skills while also honing them.
